# Azbound Core

This is a mod for Starbound that contains systems to be used by other mods. It is not intended for independent distribution, but rather to be shaded into mods built upon it at the time of their first distribution. 

While it was made for my own use, it is designed with flexibility and extension in mind, such that it can be used by others, to be derived or learned from, forked, extended, modified, in whole or in part. However, if you do redistribute AzCore assets, please bear in mind the shading guidelines (yet to be written) to avoid mod conflicts.

AzC was originally systems made for ExpandedRacialEquipment, which I then used in other mods during development. These assets were later extracted from ExRaEq and made into AzCore.
